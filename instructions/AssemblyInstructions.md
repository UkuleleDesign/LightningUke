# Lightning Uke Assembly Instructions 

## 1. Prepare Printed Parts  

Download [STL files](https://github.com/UkuleleDesign/LightningUke/tree/master/stl) for 3D printing. Depends on the printer size, you might need to rotate the model in 45 degrees.

Print all 3 files in 20% infill rate, with no support material and at least 2 layers of shell

Now you have a non-electrified ukulele!

## 5. Solder the Circuit 

Get your tools and electronic parts based on the [component list](https://github.com/UkuleleDesign/LightningUke/blob/master/ComponentList.md)
