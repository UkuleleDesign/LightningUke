# Lightning Uke Assembly Instructions 

## 1. Prepare Printed Parts  

![](instructions/IMG_3761.jpg)

Download [STL files](https://github.com/UkuleleDesign/LightningUke/tree/master/stl) for 3D printing. Print all 3 files in PLA, with following configuration:

* Infill: 20%
* Layer height: 0.20 mm
* Shells: 2 
* Support material and raft: No

Depends on the printer size, you might need to rotate the model in 45 degrees

The whole prints takes around 15.5 hours (body: 9 hours, neck: 4 hours, handle: 2.5 hours) on a Replicator 2. You can also [purchase](http://ukulele.design/#purchase) a DIY kit from the project website
	
## 2. Assemble the Body

Slide the handle into neck, and insert joints into body
